## Introduction
- Existing UGC VQA models strive to quantify quality degradation mainly from technical aspect, with a few considering aesthetic or semantic aspects, but no model has addressed all three aspects simultaneously.
- The demand for high-resolution and high-frame-rate videos on social media platforms presents new challenges for VQA tasks, as they must ensure effectiveness while also meeting real-time requirements.

## the proposed COVER

*This inspires us to develop comprehensive and efficient model for UGC VQA task*

### COVER

Results comparison:
|  Dataset: YT-UGC    | SROCC | KROCC | PLCC | RMSE | Run Time  |
| ----  |    ----   |   ----  |      ----     |   ----  | ---- |
| [**COVER**](https://github.com/vztu/COVER/release/Model/COVER.pth) | 0.9143 | 0.7413 | 0.9122 | 0.2519 | 79.37ms |
| TVQE (Wang *et al*, CVPRWS 2024) | 0.9150 | 0.7410 | 0.9182 | ------- | 705.30ms |
| Q-Align (Zhang *et al, CVPRWS 2024) | 0.9080 | 0.7340 | 0.9120 | ------- | 1707.06ms |
| SimpleVQA+ (Sun *et al, CVPRWS 2024) | 0.9060 | 0.7280 | 0.9110 | ------- | 245.51ms |

The run time is measured on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. A clip
of 30 frames of 4K resolution 3840√ó2160 is used as input.

## Install

The repository can be installed via the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vztu/COVER 
cd COVER 
pip install -e . 
mkdir pretrained_weights 
cd pretrained_weights 
wget https://github.com/vztu/COVER/release/Model/COVER.pth
cd ..
```


## Evaluation: Judge the Quality of Any Video

### Try on Demos
You can run a single command to judge the quality of the demo videos in comparison with videos in VQA datasets. 

```shell
    python evaluate_one_video.py -v ./demo/video_1.mp4
```

or 

```shell
    python evaluate_one_video.py -v ./demo/video_2.mp4
```

Or choose any video you like to predict its quality:


```shell
    python evaluate_one_video.py -v $YOUR_SPECIFIED_VIDEO_PATH$
```

### Outputs

The script can directly score the video's overall quality (considering all perspectives).

```shell
    python evaluate_one_video.py -v $YOUR_SPECIFIED_VIDEO_PATH$
```

The final output score is the sum of all perspectives.


## Evaluate on a Exsiting Video Dataset


```shell
    python evaluate_one_dataset.py -in $YOUR_SPECIFIED_DIR$ -out $OUTPUT_CSV_PATH$
```

## Evaluate on a Set of Unlabelled Videos


```shell
    python evaluate_a_set_of_videos.py -in $YOUR_SPECIFIED_DIR$ -out $OUTPUT_CSV_PATH$
```

The results are stored as `.csv` files in cover_predictions in your `OUTPUT_CSV_PATH`.

Please feel free to use COVER to pseudo-label your non-quality video datasets.


## Data Preparation

We have already converted the labels for most popular datasets you will need for Blind Video Quality Assessment,
and the download links for the **videos** are as follows:

:book: LSVQ: [Github](https://github.com/baidut/PatchVQ)

:book: KoNViD-1k: [Official Site](http://database.mmsp-kn.de/konvid-1k-database.html)

:book: LIVE-VQC: [Official Site](http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/LIVEVQC)

:book: YouTube-UGC: [Official Site](https://media.withyoutube.com)

*(Please contact the original authors if the download links were unavailable.)*

After downloading, kindly put them under the `../datasets` or anywhere but remember to change the `data_prefix` respectively in the [config file](cover.yml).

# Training: Adapt COVER to your video quality dataset!

Now you can employ ***head-only/end-to-end transfer*** of COVER to get dataset-specific VQA prediction heads. 

```shell
    python transfer_learning.py -t $YOUR_SPECIFIED_DATASET_NAME$
```

For existing public datasets, type the following commands for respective ones:

- `python transfer_learning.py -t val-kv1k` for KoNViD-1k.
- `python transfer_learning.py -t val-ytugc` for YouTube-UGC.
- `python transfer_learning.py -t val-cvd2014` for CVD2014.
- `python transfer_learning.py -t val-livevqc` for LIVE-VQC.

As the backbone will not be updated here, the checkpoint saving process will only save the regression heads. To use it, simply replace the head weights with the official weights [COVER.pth](https://github.com/vztu/COVER/release/Model/COVER.pth).

We also support ***end-to-end*** fine-tune right now (by modifying the `num_epochs: 0` to `num_epochs: 15` in `./cover.yml`). It will require more memory cost and more storage cost for the weights (with full parameters) saved, but will result in optimal accuracy.
